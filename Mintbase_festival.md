## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Mintbase Festival Brazil: IRL festival with presentations, speeches, videos.. etc.

### Overview


This is a community initiative that kicks off with launching an exciting Crypto Festival with workshops, fireside chats and some special gamified experiences. Producing engaging videos and different types of compelling content as well.

Which will then be followed with more educational content and weekly meetups to build the momentum.

Our island, Florianopolis is Brazil’s Web3 powerhouse. Known nationally as the Silicon island. However despite the rapid growth and adoption of the industry.. Brazil still lacks events, education and content.

As you may know, the Near community in Brazil is not precisely insignificant. Events like this, in my opinion, could assist in a variety of aspects:

Community, content (video and otherwise), marketing, attracting builders, co-promotion campaigns.. Etc.

### Project Details

For the purpose of accurate representation, and for relevancy’s sake - Since it’s not a technical product - we created some slides that showcase the following details:

- Actual Videos of past editions of previous events
- Examples of co-marketing campaigns, number of attendees, special guests.. etc.
- Partners, speakers and collabs
- Marketing statistics, content reach.. etc.
- Geographic benefits for Mintbase and Near.
- Team Structure, detailed budget, strategic location.. etc.
- What will be provided, what benefits we aim to provide.

P.S: We chose Pitch.com because their slides allow for watching the videos without leaving the platform, so you can judge all the details, statistics, quality.. In one link:

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 

Marketing, content marketing, community building, cross-promotion campaigns.. And other related fields.

- Who is your target audience?

Anywhere from builders, developers, biz-dev personnel, to start-ups that are undecided which chain to build on… As well as Web3 enthusiasts as a whole.

An interesting piece of data we’ve gathered from past events is that around 30% of the attendees turned out to be biz dev. After all, most builders, developers and business development teams appreciate live events for more direct networking and all the collaboration opportunities that open up.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

Marketing Benefits: Cross-marketing campaigns are very efficient in amplifying the reach. (Examples are attached in the Slides, as well as results, statistics, reach parameters, and other benefits of having a large social media footprint in a concentrated amount of time shared across hundred of accounts from attendees, speakers, partners and organizers)

Other benefits include: Evergreen content from the presentation, speeches.. etc.

BD Benefits: as past experiences have shown, a medium-large would likely result in a plethora of new clients, integration opportunities, co-marketing campaigns, and all sorts of collaborations.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?

As far as we can see, in the Near ecosystem events pages. There is no event hosted by Near, mostly Near featuring in events produced by other companies with multiple guests. Which is fantastic.

In this case, we wouldn’t be competing with anybody from the ecosystem, rather inviting all the Near communities in Brazil, as well as all sorts of web3 enthusiasts and professional to learn more about Near.. As well as some crypto outlets.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have not submitted any improvement proposals. Due to not being a tech product, we do not have any interface iterations, wireframes...

However we are a live project with tons of workshops organized, and two festivals with multiple international companies. So the status I assume would be: Active.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

Similarly, Since it’s a community, marketing, IRL event.. The majority of this section is not-applicable to our project (Architecture diagrams, API calls, Dockerfiles..)

Which is why we’ve made those slides with as much detailed information as possible.

It includes marketing stats, videos of past events, cross-marketing examples (shared by established companies), number of attendees, which benefits you get, experience of the team members, detailed costs and budget..  Etc.

Anything else we need to provide, please let us know.
